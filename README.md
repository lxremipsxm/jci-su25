## Design Phase

### Sketching out designs 
#### Design 1 (5/26 onwards)
The primary goal of this project is to create an automation that badges card for a user in a certain order, one that is both scalable and quick. For my first prototype, I'm creating a solution that can badge 16 cards in quick succession. It consists of a drum rotated accurately by a stepper motor. The drum has 16 holes that fit card slots into them. These card slots are lifted by a cam (operated by a micro servo) into the range of a stationary reader. 

In order to scale this design up, an additional cam must be placed under each new reader. Since micro servos are inexpensive, this design is simultaneously cost effective. Ideally, the larger the drum, the more readers can be incorporated.

#### Onshape
This is my first time using Onshape. I spent about a day learning Onshape and how to create models accurate to scale. I then set out to create the models by sketching designs on faces and extruding them as necessary. Throughout the process, the design remained unchanged, but I made one significant revision: making the range of motion of the cams a little larger and moving the readers further away from the cards in order to prevent interference/reading multiple cards accidentally.


#### Print
I've sent the .stl files to be printed by robu.in, which I will receive within a week's time. The print files are saved as "Assembly2.stl" and "Assembly2_verX.stl" in the 3D/ directory, and the final product will look like the contents of "Prototype_Assembly.stl"
